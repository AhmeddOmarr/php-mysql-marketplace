### Installation

To get started with the PHP-MySQL Marketplace, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Iqbolshoh/php-mysql-marketplace.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd php-mysql-marketplace
   ```

3. **Set Up the Database:**
   - Create a new MySQL database:
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE marketplace_db;
     ```

   - Import the `database.sql` file located in the `db` directory to set up the initial database structure:
     ```bash
     mysql -u yourusername -p marketplace_db < db/database.sql
     ```

4. **Configure Database Connection:**
   - Open the `config.php` file in the root directory.
   - Update the database credentials to match your MySQL setup:
     ```php
     <?php

         public function __construct() {
             $servername = "localhost";
             $username = "your_username";
             $password = "password";
             $dbname = "marketplace_db";

             $this->conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

             if ($this->conn->connect_error) {
                 die("Connection failed: " . $this->conn->connect_error);
             }
         }
     ```
   - Note: You should add the `class Database` in the `config.php` file and call the `getConnection` method to connect to the database.

5. **Run the Application:**
   - Deploy the application on a PHP-compatible server (e.g., Apache or Nginx).
   - Access the marketplace through your web browser at `http://localhost/php-mysql-marketplace`.
